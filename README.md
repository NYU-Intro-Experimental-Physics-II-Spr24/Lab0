# Lab0

Lab0 for IEP II Spring 2024

LAB0 IS DUE BY THE BEGINNING OF YOUR LAB SECTION NEXT WEEK (FEB 5 or FEB 6). 

This read me and associated assignment are adapted from [Jeremey Manning's Psych 32 Assignment Hello, World!](github.com/ContextLab/psyc32-hello-world/) and from [Marc Gershow's NYUExperimentalPhysics1-2021/Assignment0
](github.com/NYU-IEP-2022-2023-Assignments/Assignment0).


# IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT LAB0 DELIVERABLES
Lab0 has **two** deliverables:
1. A lab report, which you will write in Overleaf and submit on Brightspace. Please use the template [here]() to write your lab report. 
2. A Colab notebook, which you will submit via Github Classroom. The instructions for opening, editing, and submitting this notebook for Lab0 are the same as for Assignment1 that you completed last week.


# Lab report instructions
We will use [Overleaf]() to write lab reports in this course. Here is a general [template and instructions]() for your lab reports which also contains some useful examples. For Lab0 lab report, please start from the [Lab0 template]() and complete all the TODOs. Submit a pdf of your report on Brightspace BY THE BEGINNING OF YOUR LAB SECTION NEXT WEEK (FEB 5 or FEB 6). 


# Colab notebook instructions 
## Setup
Use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/AfqMQJGp) to officially accept Lab0. When you accept an assignment (e.g., using the GitHub classroom link above) this uses the assignment's template repository to create a personal "fork" (copy) of the files.  A message should inform you where this fork is located (i.e., a web address); this will normally be something like `https://github.com/NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24//Lab0-<username>`, where "`<username>`" is replaced with your actual GitHub username.

Next, open (click) the `Lab0.ipynb` notebook and then click on the blue "Open in Colab" button at the top. A new tab or window should open in your browser, displaying the notebook in Google Colaboratory.

In order to submit your assignment **you'll need to save an editable copy of your notebook**. (You cannot save changes to the original version of the notebook.) Click `File > Save a copy in Drive` and then save your copy of the notebook as `Lab0.ipynb` (i.e., remove the "`Copy of`" text that gets automatically appended to the beginning of the filename). Close the original notebook; you no longer need it. 

Ensure that Colaboratory has access to your private repositories on GitHub.  (By default, your assignment repositories will be accessible only to you and the course instructor.) To give Colaboratory access to your private repositories:
- Navigate to [http://colab.research.google.com/github](http://colab.research.google.com/github)
- Make sure the "Include Private Repos" checkbox is checked
- In the popup window, sign into your GitHub account and authorize Colab to read private files

## Do the assignment
All of the assignment instructions are in the Colab (.ipynb) notebook. You should do your work on the assignment in the *copied* notebook (i.e., the copied notebook that you have the ability to save and edit). Once you have gone through the entire notebook and filled in any missing pieces of code and/or text, you can submit your work. 

## Submit your work
Submitting the assignment entails syncing your copy of the notebook with your GitHub repository (in this case, `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Lab0-<username>`, with `<username>` replaced with your GitHub username).  From within Colaboratory, open your notebook and click File > Save a copy in GitHub.  Select `NYU-Intro-Experimental-Physics-II-Spr24/Lab0-<username>` from the Repository drop-down menu, and type '`Lab0.ipynb`' into the File path text box.  Optionally, you may also enter a description into the "Commit message" text box (or you can just leave the default message).  Make sure that the "Include a link to Colaboratory" box is checked, and press "OK".  A new tab or window should open up, displaying your submitted notebook from within your GitHub repository. Submit your code BY THE BEGINNING OF YOUR LAB SECTION NEXT WEEK (FEB 5 or FEB 6).
